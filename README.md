#UNIACCO ASSIGNMENT

##USED LIBRARIES 
1. React-icons - for the icons used in logo and buttons.
2. React-swipeable - to add the swipe behaviour in the banner carousel.
3. Styled-components - for the styling of the components.

## Steps to Run

Just simply run "npm install" first and then "npm start".

##Notes

I would have implemented date picker and filter too, but could not because of time constraints.

Hope you will find it worthy.
